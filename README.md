# alt

This is a prototype build for the Matsuyama JHS & ELS ALT's.

The goal of this site is to give ALT's a local space to get
settled in in Matsuyama, informed on local events, rules and
regulations, seasonal information, etc.

The scope of this site is NOT intended for the Chuyo region,
but specifically for the Matsuyama JHS & ELS ALT'S.
